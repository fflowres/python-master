=======
This project is a port of Python 2.7 for the Marmalade SDK ( tested version 7.3 )

- Full bindings to _sockets module
- OpenSSL support, see patch (mkb &  version.c)
- Created a new c module that transparently connects marmalade random functions to python random module ( see s3eRandomMod ) removing /dev/urandom dependancy

This is a code dumping ground right now (aug 25,2014), 
- compiled libraries work

- Don't bother trying to compile this yet, half the code isnt uploaded.
